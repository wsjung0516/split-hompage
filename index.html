                      This program is a system that analyzes computed tomography
                      (CT) taken by a patient for lung cancer diagnosis with
                      artificial intelligence. First, artificial intelligence
                      analyzes, and analysis experts mark the unanalyzed parts
                      again. Also, this marked part is applied to the system
                      that allows artificial intelligence to learn again.

                      The frontend developer develops the UI so that the lung
                      cancer analysis expert can easily understand the results
                      of the artificial intelligence analysis, In addition, the
                      developer developed a function that allows analysis
                      experts to easily mark the parts that have not been
                      analyzed with artificial intelligence. CT for analysis can
                      be analyzed by reading PACS (picture archiving and
                      communication system) information collected at a hospital,
                      or by uploading CT data collected by an analyst or a
                      doctor.

                      The core UI of this program was developed by combining the
                      library of cornerstone and cornerstone-tools with Angular
                      Framework.

                      At the time of joining the company in Dec 2019, there were
                      two developers. One is the frontend and the other is the
                      backend developer, and there was a program developed by
                      the backend developer using Angular. At that time, the
                      frontend developer had a new employee who had studied
                      Angular for about 3 months. When I joined the development
                      team after joining the company, the program developed by
                      the backend developer was running. However, since the
                      program was not modularized, it was not possible to add
                      functions to the program or to modify the existing ones.
                      It is a program developed with Angular 7.0, but the
                      program is not modularized, and the files are main.ts 1
                      file 9,900 lines, main.html 1 file 5,500 lines, main.css 1
                      file 3,500 lines, it was a program made of 3 files.
                      However, since this program was developed including the
                      cornerstone-core and cornerstone-tools libraries that
                      process medical images, the basic functions of image
                      processing were expressed to some extent. The problem,
                      however, was that it could no longer be maintained. And,
                      they were too slow to display images, so they had no
                      commercial value.

                    <span>
                      Backend was simply developed with nodejs and express, but
                      in the initial version, there were no basic functions such
                      as pagination. Of course, since it could not work properly
                      in the Frontend, the upgrade of the function in the
                      Backend had not been carried out yet.

                    <span>
                      I developed additional functions while understanding the
                      existing program at first. At this time, I trained an
                      existing Frontend developer about 30 to 60 minutes of
                      Angular every day for a year. It took me about 4 months to
                      understand the program. So, after understanding to some
                      extent, I proceeded to separate the program into each
                      module that composes the module. We tried to make the
                      modules as small as possible because we had to re-develop
                      with maintenance and function additions in mind in the
                      future. In order to reinforce the late image expression,
                      Angular technology was applied and optimized.<br />
                      It takes about 9 months.

                  </li>

                  <li class="">
                    <span>
                      Once the functions of the frontend have progressed to some
                      extent, the main program was re-developed by applying
                      nestjs, prisma, etc. to the program of the backend. It
                      also added features such as pagenation.<br />
                      It takes about 3 months.
